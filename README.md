Pokémon Ultra Sun/ Ultra Moon Competitive QR Code Database

Introduction

I MENTION MY DISCORD SERVER MANY TIMES IN THIS README SO HERE IS MY SERVER
https://discord.gg/QsrxTvt

Hey Everybody kicking it Retro and I am Retrosol. I do Past Generations Pokemon Content, and Various 8 Bit/ 16 Bit Video game content.

TO BE CLEAR THIS IS A SMOGON COMPETITIVE Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon DATABASE THIS means you will not find NON-COMPETITIVE Event Pokemon here. You may Find Competitive EVENT POKEMON WITH COMPETITIVE MOVESETS.

I have spent 12.5 months, to aquire each and every single piece of this DATABASE 100% Legitimately. THAT INCLUDES GTS/TRADES/SRS/SELF HATCHES ETC.

Although obtained with completely legal means this database will serve as a way for Pokemon Genners, to have a BASE of Every Single Possible /and feasible Competitive Pokemon Combination, with complete Legality. **EVERY FILE IN MY DATABASE SHOULD BE DRAG AND DROP LEGALITY AND EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK ON WI-FI AND BATTLE SPOT! THIS WILL MAKE GENNING EFFORTLESS, AND SPEED THE EFFORTS OF POKEMON EVEN BEING GENNED AS MOST LIKELY THERE IS ALREADY A SET FOR IT.

A FEW THINGS TO NOTE

    WHILE I HIGHLY CONSIDERED THE UNTOUCHABLES/UNTRADEABLES TO BE A PART OF THIS DATABASE AS THEY ARE VALUED BY COLLECTORS... I DECIDED THIS DATABASE, SINCE EVERYTHING IS LEGAL, AND OBTAINED THROUGH LEGITIMATE MEANS, I WILL NOT INCLUDE THESE ANYWHERE IN THE DATABASE. HOWEVER.... I GENERATE THESE POKEMON ON MY DISCORD SERVER THE LINK IS ON THE VERY TOP OF THE README. I USE RETROGEN AND MY WEBSITE TO KEEP TRACK OF ORDERS IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, WHILE MY SERVER OFFERS GENNING REQUESTS EVERYTHING IN MY DATABASE IS LEGITIMATELY OBTAINED, AND AS CLOSE TO USUM ORIGINS AS POSSIBLE FOR VGC PLAYERS, AGAIN DO NOTE EVERYTHING HAS MY NICKNAMES, MY OT, MY POKEBALLS AND MY SID, AND TID. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT RETROGEN, I SUGGEST YOU CHECK OUT MY SERVER. :3

    Q: RETRO HOW DID YOU DO ALL OF THIS LEGITIMATELY?

a: FIRSTLY, I OWN EVERY SINGLE POKEMON GAME, SECONDLY FROM XY-ORAS I WAS AN APPROVED CLONER AND HAD TONS AND TONS OF WARES IN THE TIMES TRANSFER MOVES WERE AVAILABLE. I SIMPLY COME SUN AND MOON COLLECTED OVER 85 EGG SEED COMBINATIONS TO HATCH ANY TYPE OF BALL/MON/GENDER RATIO SELF BRED SHINY POKEMON I DESIRED, IE SHINY HA HP FIRE DIVE BALL PIPLUP OR HA DIVE BALL/ SAFARI BALL SHINY GLISCOR, THESE ARE SIMPLY A FEW EXAMPLES, I BEGAN WITH THE 50/50 RATIO AND FROM THERE COLLECTED AND TRADED FOR HI IVE POKEMON AND SELF BRED THEM INTO SHINY AND BALL SPECIFICATIONS. THIRDLY, I ALSO OWN FIRE RED AND POKEMON BLACK AND THE NEWLY RELEASED VIRTUAL CONSOLE

    I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO JOIN MY DISCORD SERVER FOR UNLIMITED GENNING, IN ADDITION TO A QR DATABASE. I DECIDED TO MAKE MY DATABASE 100% USABLE EVEN IF YOUR ON A MOBILE PLATFORM. DO NOTE HOWEVER IN ORDER FOR THE QR CODES IN MY DATABASE TO BE SCANNED INTO USUM VIA MOBILE, OR YOUR PC YOU MUST HAVE NINTENDO 3DS CUSTOM FIRMWARE. EVEN THOUGH MY SERVER OFFERS UNLIMITED GENNING I MYSELF AM A 29 YEAR OLD ADULT FULL TIME WORKER WITH A CHILD I AM A FAST GENNER, BUT I HAVE A LIFE TOO SO PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL.

Every Single Pokemon is Shiny and in Matching Pokeballs, for Collectors, HOWEVER EVERYTHING IN THIS DATABASE HAS MY TID AND SID where applicable. **if you USE MY DATABASE IN ANY TRADING FORUM TO GET THE POKEMON OF YOUR DREAMS...., YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT POKEMON TRADING SITE AND THIS DATABASE AND ANY CONTENTS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED OR ENCOURAGED TO BE USED IN TRADE SITES DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK! THESE POKEMON INCLUDE THE HA'S IF POSSIBLE, AND THE CORRECT HIDDEN POWERS AS WELL

You need Homebrew Launcher to take complete advantage of the Database. As Homebrew Launcher allows you to use at least PKSM, and Checkpoint to be able to inject Pokemon, or Simply Entire Save Files. As some Pokemon in the Database are Createable, and Injectable but NOT TRADEABLE http://smealum.github.io/3ds/ - Link for Possible Homebrew Launcher Exploits IF YOU ARE ON 11.6 BUT HAVE SPECIFIC GAMES/ CORRECT FLASHKART / OR A PREVIOUSLY HACKED CONSOLE THIS IS STILL POSSIBLE.

PRIMARY Means accessing Homebrew for the first TIME. SOUNDHAX Was primary, as was RPGPWN 1A :Games you NEED for PRIMARY access are as follows.

FreakyForms Deluxe, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time/ **REQUIRES 3DS POWERSAVES TO BE PRIMARY**, Cubic Ninja, Super Smash Bros 3ds - N3DS **ONLY** *THIS IS MOST COMPLICATED METHOD AND **REQUIRES** LINUX!**

If Using Please immediately install SECONDARY HAX, which REQUIRES PRIMARY HAX, section 1A covers this.

2A : Games/Software you need for SECONDARY HAX, which REQUIRES PRIMARY HAX are the following

Steel Diver: Sub Wars, Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon, Citizens of Earth (either v1 or v2), Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Monster Hunter Generations or Monster Hunter X (without the game updates installed), and an internet connection during installation, Pixel Paint

I realize it's been 12.5 months and its Not Completed, so heere is why

https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/36970-pok%C3%A9mon-showdown-importable-to-legit-pkhex-files-converter/ ^ This Program is what I have been using to create my Database.
However this program is INCREDIBLY finnicky when it comes to the formatting. Sometimes Pokemon Showdown, and Pokepaste Modify slight variations of the formatting, that ImportableConverterUSUM will accept.

so now using KEYSAVE, I am now able to customize the formatting of my live read Nintendo 3ds Files, into a File Type My Database Uses. This is also so that is useable, regardless of which PKHEX you are using, the Regular, or Architdates Auto-Legality Mod

Furthermore, ImportablePKHex does NOT Handle Valid PID Encryption This is via ENCOUNTER TYPE, INVALID PID FOR PREVIOUS GENERATIONS, OR SHINY ENCOUNTER MISMATCHES THAT ARE SHINY LEGALLY, AND LEGITIMATE While PID Encryption errors are very easy to ignore, They make where the Pokemon Have the Invalid Flag Regardless of what is done.

**IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SEND ME A REQUEST ON DISCORD
Retrosol#3697, and tell me which pokemon in database you would like, me to trade to you.**

Installing

Use any unzipping program. (Winrar recommended) You will get a folder, with a bunch of folders inside, telling you what Tiers Pokemon are in There are folders for each tierset of Pokemon.

You need to download PKHex, and drag my files into your save file from your Pokemon Ultra Sun and Pokemon Ultra Moon. https://projectpokemon.org/forums/files/file/1-pkhex/?do=download&csrfKey=76ee749ce81dfc5f42f3649fc79cfa97
